Data representation coursework

Please find in this git hub folder all the files for the data representation final coursework.

The experience should start on the project entry page where you can choose to view the cheese or wine database.

The files_source cheese.txt and source_wine.txt are the files used to create the sql databases.

I hope you enjoy fibanachi wines and cheese.

Thanks Jonathan
